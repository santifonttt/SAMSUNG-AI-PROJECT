# Audio Diagnostic AI – Vehicle Fault Classification

> **Capstone Project** | Samsung Innovation Campus AI Diploma & Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV)

## Project Description

**Audio Diagnostic AI** is an AI project designed to automatically detect and classify engine and mechanical faults based on audio recordings from vehicles.

The main goal of the project is to help mechanics and technicians identify issues quickly and accurately by analyzing engine sounds, vibrations, and other mechanical noises. Instead of relying on manual inspection or intuition, this system uses audio feature extraction and deep learning models to pinpoint specific problems.

---

## Key Objectives

- **Analyze** engine and mechanical sounds to detect anomalies.
- **Classify** multiple types of faults, such as engine knocking, misfires, or bearing noises.
- **Automate** vehicle diagnostics, reducing inspection time and improving accuracy.
- **Integrate** signal processing, audio feature extraction, and AI classification into a practical tool for automotive diagnostics.

---

## Features and Achievements

- **Audio Feature Extraction**: Uses YAMNet embeddings to convert raw audio into meaningful data for classification.
- **Fault Classification**: Implements deep learning models capable of differentiating multiple fault types.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Designed to work with real engine and mechanical sounds in noisy environments.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Can be connected to a user interface to allow recording or uploading audio for immediate diagnostics.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Ensures reliability with accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.

## Tech Stack

This project relies on the following Python libraries and frameworks:

- **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** – for building and running deep learning models
- **[Keras](https://keras.io/)** – high-level neural network API for model design and training
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)** – numerical operations and array management
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** – data manipulation and analysis
- **[Groq](https://www.groq.com/)** - for LLM models
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** – building interactive web apps for diagnostics
- **[Librosa](https://librosa.org/)** – audio analysis

This project bridges the gap between complex automotive diagnostics and everyday drivers, offering an **intelligent and accessible tool** for vehicle maintenance awareness.
